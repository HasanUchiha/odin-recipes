    <h2>Ruhi Fish cooking method </h2>
        <p>Some cooking methods are better suited to cooking fish from frozen than others. 
        This is because frozen fish tends to release a lot of moisture while cooking, 
        so pan searing is not recommended. Instead of the fish browning in the pan and 
        becoming crisp, the water released while cooking steams the fish and prevents it
         from browning. Instead, stick to baking, broiling, steaming, or poaching.</p>
         <p>The 
         latter two are some of the easiest and most forgiving ways to cook fish from 
         frozen and result in tender, delicate filets. And unlike pan searing, baking and 
         broiling help evaporate the moisture thatâ€™s released during cooking so the fish has
          the chance to brown. (And browned fish equals flavorful fish!) </p><br>
